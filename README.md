## ðŸ“ˆ DAX Measures

The following DAX measures were created for analysis:

1. **On-Time Flights**:
   ```DAX
   On-Time Flights = 
   COUNTROWS(
       FILTER(
           DelayedFlights,
           DelayedFlights[ArrDelay] = 0 && DelayedFlights[Cancelled] = 0 && DelayedFlights[Diverted] = 0
       )
   )
